		<p>Okay. So, here is our internal links page, and we have a couple of links. One it says linking to a file in the same directory, and the one is the DIV. That's the a tag surrounding the div tag that says DIV linking to a file in the same directory. And if we click that, we're going to go to this same-directory.html page which basically just provides a link back to our original page. What's interesting to note here is that the first link, linking to a file in the same directory, is clearly an inline tag since it's not forcing itself to go to a new line. But yet in the second case, div linking to a file in the same directory, we're surrounding the div tag with our a tag. So what's going on here? Are we using block level element, the div, inside an inline element? Well, turns out things are little bit more interesting. Let's take a look at the a tag as defined in the W3C specification. If you take a look closely, the a tag is both a flow content and a phrasing content.
		What's really neat about fragment identifiers is if you click on one and you have them in URL, you could copy and paste this URL and send it to a friend as a bookmark. And when they paste it into their browser, they will be taken to this page and jump straight to the section that was pointed to by the fragment identifier. Now I am on my local hard drive, and I'm not on a server so obviously sending this link that points to my local hard drive is not going to do any good. But if we're on a server, this link with the section identifier would have taken anybody anywhere, with a connection to the internet, to the proper page and to the proper section of that page. While fragment identifiers are very useful in order to jump to different parts of the same page, recently they have become even more important as they're used for navigation within the SPA or Single Page Applications. And SPA, Single Page Applications have become extremely popular. So knowing how fragment identifiers work is an important step towards being able to code single page applications.</p>
